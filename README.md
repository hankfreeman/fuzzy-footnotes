# fuzzy-footnotes
Automated Footnote Compilation

## Purpose

The purpose of this code is to automatically pull and organize footnotes from an expert report for ease of printing. \n
Many times, the same footnotes are used in expert reports but the ordering is different.\n
This code prompts the user to link to an excel sheet with all the footnote names.\n
It will then use fuzzy matching to look for a matching filename in one of two source locations.\n
If a match is found, the match is placed in a target folder and numbered correctly.\n
The user can then print the footnotes as a batch instead of one by one.\n
